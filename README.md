# 2D-to-3D-ImageConversion
This project is being worked. Stay tuned for updates.......
# Project
Use of Deep Learning to Create 3D BMW-10 Car Models from 2D Images
# Domain
 Image transformation - Cars
# Data
The data that is used for this project is extracted from the Stanford cars dataset. The cars dataset contains more than 500 images of BMW class 10 cars. Each image contains one car taken at different locations at different angles
